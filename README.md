# CharacterSuite

A web app for creating Pathfinder Character Sheets.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) using [Nrwl Nx](https://nrwl.io/nx).

## Project Setup

1) Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2) Install and run [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
3) Install the Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
4) Install project dependencies: `npm install`
4) Copy the file `.env` into a new file `.env.development` and fill in details

## Running the project

Use `ng serve server` to build and run the NestJS REST API. You can see the Swagger UI running at http://localhost:3333/api/.

Use `ng serve client` to build and run the Angular front end. It runs at http://localhost:4200/.

Both will automatically recompile changed files while the server is running.
